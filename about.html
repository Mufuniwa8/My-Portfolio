                  </div>
                  <p>Mufuniwa Mbedzi is a young man that was born in Vuwani a small village in Venda(Limpopo)after a few months his mother moved to Pretoria with him for a better life.After a few years Mufuniwa started pre-school where he would learn to socialise with other kids and people as he was a quiet and shy kid most of his childhood.Few years after pre-school Mufuniwa started primary school where he would start experiencing the harsh reality of life as he was bullied buy other kids and that forced him to learn to defend him self and that also helped to build his confidence.Now that he had confidence in himself he started participating in school sports such as track and football where he made his on name by winning medals and trophies. That installed a winning mentality in everything he does if he loses he makes sure that the next time he has to take that number one spot or he has to do better that last time and that helped him achieve a lot in life as later on in his teen years he started focusing on things that can help him grow mentally such as starting small businesses with his mother sometimes with his friends. this helped him to be able to face any challenges that come his way and he likes trying new things even if it is something that hes never done before. So yes that is a short summary of Mufuniwa's up brining </p>
